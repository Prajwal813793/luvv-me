Dinner with Me?
This project is a simple webpage that presents a question "Dinner with me?" with a corresponding GIF. There are two buttons, one with the text "Yes!" and another with the text "No!!"

The "No!!" button will move randomly on the screen every 0.8 seconds when the mouse pointer is over it. The "Yes!" button will trigger an alert message "I love you too!" when clicked.
